# Calculator-App
The application is still a work in progress as there is a bug in a JavaScript function still being searched.
Once bug is found, the calculator should be able to calculate in any order of operations.

*Update* app has been debugged and is fully functioning.
*bug/error* HTML and CSS ID tags rematched to facilitate 'click' operation.
